# UsingExplicitReadWriteLock

## Description

This Java program demonstrates the use of explicit read-write locks (`ReentrantReadWriteLock`) to control access to
shared resources. It provides methods for reading and writing content while ensuring thread safety.

## Code Explanation

- The `UsingExplicitReadWriteLock` class contains methods `showContent()` and `writeContent()` to read and write
  content, respectively.
- Read operations are protected by acquiring a read lock using `ReentrantReadWriteLock.readLock()` before accessing the
  content.
- Write operations are protected by acquiring a write lock using `ReentrantReadWriteLock.writeLock()` before modifying
  the content.
- The `main` method spawns multiple threads to concurrently read and write content, demonstrating the synchronization
  provided by the explicit read-write locks.

## Running the Code

To run the code:

1. Compile the Java file.
2. Execute the compiled class file.

## Usage

- Modify the code as needed for your application.
- Ensure proper error handling in production environments.
- Experiment with different thread counts and sleep durations for testing and performance evaluation.

## Dependencies

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- IDE or text editor for Java development
